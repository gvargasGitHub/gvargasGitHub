- Hi, Iâ€™m @gvargasGitHub
I have been developing frontend and backend portals for the company where I work for 12 years. The languages I have worked on are PHP, JavaScript, Css and HTML.
I have also worked with databases in MYSQL.
I am currently developing my ATUSAN Framework on which I have supported my latest projects.
